Work on the single next task for spec project-foundation. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! I've successfully completed Task 2 for the project-foundation spec. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task 2 Completed: Set up test projects with xUnit and ArchUnitNET

### Created Test Projects:

1. **FluentPDF.Architecture.Tests** (tests/FluentPDF.Architecture.Tests/)
   - Target Framework: net8.0
   - NuGet Packages: ArchUnitNET.xUnit, xUnit, xunit.runner.visualstudio
   - Project References: All three src projects (App, Core, Rendering)
   - Base Class: ArchitectureTestBase with Architecture object initialization

2. **FluentPDF.Core.Tests** (tests/FluentPDF.Core.Tests/)
   - Target Framework: net8.0
   - NuGet Packages: xUnit, FluentAssertions, Moq, AutoFixture
   - Project Reference: FluentPDF.Core only (headless, no UI dependencies)
   - Base Class: TestBase with AutoFixture and Moq helper methods

3. **FluentPDF.App.Tests** (tests/FluentPDF.App.Tests/)
   - Target Framework: net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0
   - NuGet Packages: xUnit, FlaUI.Core, FlaUI.UIA3, Verify.Xunit
   - Project Reference: FluentPDF.App
   - Base Class: UITestBase with FlaUI lifecycle management

### Key Features:

- All test projects successfully compile
- Test infrastructure verified with `dotnet test` (0 tests, as expected)
- Base classes provide useful utilities for future test implementation
- Projects follow the exact specifications from the design document
- All changes committed to git with clear message

The test infrastructure is now ready for implementing actual tests in subsequent tasks.

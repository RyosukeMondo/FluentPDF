Excellent! Task 7 is now complete. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task 7 Complete: ArchUnitNET Architecture Tests

I've successfully implemented comprehensive ArchUnitNET tests to enforce architectural integrity for the FluentPDF project. Here's what was created:

### Files Created:
1. **LayerTests.cs** (5 tests)
   - Validates Core layer doesn't depend on App or Rendering
   - Ensures Core has no UI dependencies (headless testable)
   - Verifies proper unidirectional dependency flow
   - Confirms Rendering doesn't depend on App

2. **NamingTests.cs** (6 tests)
   - ViewModels must end with "ViewModel" and inherit from ObservableObject
   - Services must end with "Service"
   - Interfaces must start with "I"
   - Error types must end with "Error"
   - Test classes must end with "Tests"

3. **InterfaceTests.cs** (7 tests)
   - Services must implement corresponding interfaces (IService pattern)
   - Interfaces should be in same namespace as implementations
   - Core interfaces cannot reference UI types
   - Service interfaces must be public for DI
   - ViewModels shouldn't implement custom interfaces
   - Repositories must follow IRepository pattern

### Key Features:
- **18 total architecture rules** that will run in CI/CD
- All tests use clear `.Because()` clauses explaining the rationale
- Tests prevent architectural erosion automatically
- Enforces clean architecture principles (UI-agnostic Core, proper dependency flow)
- Ensures testability (headless ViewModels, interface-based services)

### Commits Made:
1. `85b8b46` - Implement ArchUnitNET architecture tests (task 7)
2. `846bf4d` - Add implementation log for task 7 (ArchUnitNET tests)

The tests are ready to run on Windows in CI/CD pipelines and will provide automated architectural governance for the project.

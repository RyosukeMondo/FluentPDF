# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! I have successfully completed task 1 of the project-foundation spec. Here's what was accomplished:

## Summary

I completed the first task for the project-foundation spec, which established the foundational project structure. All changes have been committed to git.

### What Was Created:

1. **Visual Studio Solution** (FluentPDF.sln)
   - Contains all three projects in a structured organization

2. **Directory.Build.props**
   - Shared MSBuild properties for all projects
   - LangVersion: latest
   - Nullable reference types enabled
   - TreatWarningsAsErrors: true
   - Code quality metrics documented (500 line/file limit, 50 line/method limit per CLAUDE.md)

3. **FluentPDF.Core** (Class Library - net8.0)
   - UI-agnostic business logic project
   - Zero UI dependencies for headless testability
   - NuGet packages installed: FluentResults, Serilog.Extensions.Logging

4. **FluentPDF.Rendering** (Class Library - net8.0)
   - PDF rendering engine project
   - Will contain PDFium P/Invoke code
   - References FluentPDF.Core

5. **FluentPDF.App** (WinUI 3 Application - net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0)
   - Main desktop application project
   - MSIX packaged
   - References both Core and Rendering projects

### Project References (Clean Architecture):
- App → Core + Rendering
- Rendering → Core  
- Core has zero dependencies (UI-agnostic)

### Build Status:
✅ FluentPDF.Core builds successfully
✅ FluentPDF.Rendering builds successfully
⚠️ FluentPDF.App requires Windows to build (WinUI 3 limitation)

All changes have been committed with a clear commit message and the task has been marked as completed in tasks.md.

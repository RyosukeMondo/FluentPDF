## Artifacts

### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** GitHub Actions build workflow compiles FluentPDF solution with automated vcpkg native library building
- **Frontend Component:** build.yml workflow
- **Backend Endpoint:** Windows Server 2022 runner with MSBuild and .NET 8
- **Data Flow:** Push/PR trigger → Checkout → Setup build tools → Cache vcpkg → Build native libs → Restore NuGet → Build solution → Upload artifacts

#### Integration
- **Description:** GitHub Actions test workflow runs all test suites and uploads TRX results with code coverage
- **Frontend Component:** test.yml workflow
- **Backend Endpoint:** Windows Server 2022 runner with .NET test framework
- **Data Flow:** Build completion → Download artifacts → Run architecture tests → Run core tests → Run app tests (conditional) → Upload TRX results → Publish test report

#### Integration
- **Description:** Quality analysis workflow placeholder for future AI-powered TRX analysis and insights
- **Frontend Component:** quality-analysis.yml workflow
- **Backend Endpoint:** Ubuntu runner for AI agent processing
- **Data Flow:** Test completion → Download TRX files → AI analysis (TODO) → Upload analysis artifacts

#### Integration
- **Description:** Visual regression workflow placeholder for Win2D headless rendering and screenshot comparison
- **Frontend Component:** visual-regression.yml workflow
- **Backend Endpoint:** Windows Server 2022 runner with Win2D capabilities
- **Data Flow:** Push/PR trigger → Check UI tests exist → Run visual regression tests (TODO) → Upload diff images

#### Integration
- **Description:** vcpkg binary caching strategy reduces build time by caching compiled native libraries
- **Frontend Component:** GitHub Actions cache@v4
- **Backend Endpoint:** GitHub Actions cache storage
- **Data Flow:** Cache key based on build-libs.ps1 hash → Restore from cache if exists → Build if cache miss → Upload to cache for future runs
